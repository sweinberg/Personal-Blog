- **Official Book Summary**:  Byung-Chul Han, a star of German philosophy, continues his passionate critique of neoliberalism, trenchantly describing a regime of technological domination that, in contrast to Foucault's biopower, has discovered the productive force of the psyche. In the course of discussing all the facets of neoliberal psychopolitics fueling our contemporary crisis of freedom, Han elaborates an analytical framework that provides an original theory of Big Data and a lucid phenomenology of emotion.
- **My Summary**: The [hegemonic]([[Cultural Hegemony]]) common sense value system of [[neoliberalism]]—communicated and reinforced through media, politics, culture, and everyday discourse—inculcates in its subjects a unique psychology that stresses self-regulation, self-commodification, and a willingness to submit to technologies of control. The neoliberal subject becomes "the entrepreneur of its own self." __Psycho-politics__ refers to neoliberalism's productive use of the psyche for purposes of cultural reproduction and continuity, and as a means for social control.

    - **Ch. 1: The Crisis of Freedom**
        - **"The Exploitation of Freedom"**
            - >"Neoliberalism represents a highly efficient, indeed an intelligent, system for exploiting freedom. Everything that belongs to practices and expressive forms of liberty – emotion, play and communication – comes to be exploited."
            - ^^**We are __projects__, not __subjects__**^^
                - >”Today, we do not deem ourselves subjugated __subjects__, but rather __projects__: always refashioning and reinventing ourselves. A sense of freedom attends passing from the state of subject to that of project."
                - >"...[this constitutes] a form of compulsion and constraint – indeed, to a __more efficient kind of subjectivation and subjugation__. As a project deeming itself free of external and alien limitations, the __I__ is now subjugating itself to internal limitations and self-constraints, which are taking the form of compulsive achievement and optimization."
            - ^^**True freedom is meaningful and fruitful human connection. So how can alienated, atomized, isolated subjects truly be free?**^^
                - >"As the entrepreneur of its own self, the neoliberal subject has no capacity for relationships with others that might be __free of purpose.__"
                - >"Originally, being free meant __being among friends__. 'Freedom' and 'friendship' have the same root in Indo-European languages. Fundamentally, freedom signifies a __relationship__. A real feeling of freedom occurs only in a fruitful relationship - when being with others brings happiness. But today's neoliberal regime leads to utter isolation; as such, it does not really free us at all."
                - >"...Marx also defines freedom in terms of a successful relationship to others: 'Only in community [with others does each] individual [have] the means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; only in the community, therefore, is personal freedom possible.' From this perspective, being free means nothing other than __self-realization with others__. Freedom is synonymous with a working community (i.e., a successful one).
            - ^^**"Freedom" as a mechanism of reproducing and propagating capital**^^
                - >"For Marx, individual freedom represents a ruse – a trick of capital. 'Free competition', which is based on the idea of individual freedom, simply amounts to the 'relation of capital to itself as another capital, i.e., the real conduct of capital as capital'."
                - >"Capital reproduces by entering into relations with itself as another form of Capital: through free competition. It copulates with the Other of itself by way of individual freedom. Capital grows inasmuch as people engage in free competition. Hereby, individual freedom amounts to servitude inasmuch as Capital lays hold of it and uses it for its own propagation. That is, Capital exploits individual freedom in order to breed: 'It is not the individuals who are set free by free competition; it is, rather, capital which is set free.'"
                - >"The __freedom of Capital__ achieves self-realization by way of individual freedom. In the process, individuals degrade into the genital organs of Capital. Individual freedom lends it an 'automatic' subjectivity of its own, which spurs it to reproduce actively."
        - **The Dictatorship of Capital**
            - ^^**Challenging Marxist conceptions of historical materialism, class conflict, and class struggle.**^^
                - Byung-Chul Han challenges one of the central tenants of Marxist thought: [[historical materialism]] (i.e., that material conditions are the catalyzing force of social evolution throughout human history, and that the contradictions of capitalism will __inevitably__ lead to its own demise, making way for the next phase of historical human development: socialism (which itself is a preliminary stage of communism), just as was the case with the transition from feudalism into capitalism. Instead, capitalism mutates into new forms: first industrial capitalism (“Fordism"), now post-industrial neoliberal and financial capitalism.
                    - >"At a certain level of development, according to Marx, the forces of production (human labour, modes of work and the material means available) come into conflict with the dominant relations of production (conditions of ownership and domination). Contradiction arises because the forces of production never stop evolving. Thus, industrialization brings forth new forces of production that come into conflict with structures of ownership and government that still resemble feudal conditions. In turn, this contradiction entails social crises: pushes to change the relations of production. For Marx, the contradiction is to be eliminated by way of the proletariat’s struggle against the bourgeoisie – which will bring forth a communist social order."
                    - >"But counter to what Marx assumed, communist revolution cannot resolve the contradiction between forces of production and relations of production. The contradiction admits no dialectical __Aufhebung__. Capitalism can always escape into the future precisely because it harbours permanent and inherent contradiction. Accordingly, industrial capitalism has now __mutated__ into neoliberalism and financial capitalism, which are implementing a post-industrial, immaterial mode of production – instead of turning into communism."
                - Byung-Chul Han also challenges the Marxist conception of the dynamic of class conflict, arguing that in the Neoliberal mutant form of capitalism of today, there is no allo-exploited (i.e., exploited by an Other) proletariat class, but auto-exploited laborers.
                    - >”As a mutant form of capitalism, neoliberalism transforms workers into __entrepreneurs__. It is not communist revolution that is now abolishing the allo-exploited working class – instead, neoliberalism is in the course of doing so. Today, everyone is an __auto-exploiting labourer in his or her own enterprise__. People are now master and slave in one. Even class struggle has transformed into an __inner struggle against oneself__."
                    - >”The cooperative ‘Multitude’ that Antonio Negri has exalted as the post-Marxist successor to the ‘proletariat’ does not describe the contemporary mode of production. Rather, conditions are defined by the __solitude__ of an entrepreneur who is isolated and self-combating and practises auto-exploitation voluntarily. As such, it is a mistake to believe that the cooperative ‘Multitude’ will overthrow the parasitic ‘Empire’ and bring forth a communist social order. The Marxist scheme to which Negri adheres will prove to have been yet another illusion."
                    - >"In fact, no proletariat exists under the neoliberal regime at all. There is no working class being exploited by those who own the means of production. When production is immaterial, everyone already owns the means of production him- or herself. The neoliberal system is no longer a class system in the proper sense. It does not consist of classes that display mutual antagonism. This is what accounts for the system’s stability."
                    - >”Today, the distinction between proletariat and bourgeoisie no longer holds either. Literally, ‘proletarian’ means someone whose sole possessions are his or her children: self-production is restricted to biological reproduction. But now the illusion prevails that every person – as a project free to fashion him- or herself at will – is capable of __unlimited self-production__. This means that a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ is structurally impossible. Today, the Dictatorship of Capital rules over everyone."
                    - >"The neoliberal regime transforms allo-exploitation into auto-exploitation; this process affects all ‘classes’. Such classless self-exploitation – which was something utterly unknown to Marx – renders impossible any social revolution based on the difference between the exploiters, on the one hand, and the exploited, on the other. Indeed, given the auto-exploiting achievement-subject’s isolation, no __political We__ is even possible that could rise up and undertake collective action."
            - ^^**Is Capital our new God?**^^
                - **Note**: Relate this to the ideas of the book [Neoliberalism's Demons: On the Political Theology of Late Capital](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=29538) by Adam Kotsko. #religion #theology
                - >"__Do we really want to be free?__ Didn’t we invent God so we wouldn’t have to be free? Before God, we are all debtors: guilty (__schuldig__). But debt – guilt – destroys freedom. Today, politicians appeal to high debt rates to explain that their freedom to act is massively restricted. Free from debt – that is, wholly free – we would truly have to __act__. Perhaps we run up debts perpetually so we won’t need to do so – that is, so we won’t need to be __free__, or __responsible__. Don’t our debts prove that we don’t have the power to be free? Could it be that Capital is a __new God__, making us guilty and debt-ridden again? Walter Benjamin held that capitalism is a religion. As he put it, capitalism represents the ‘first case of a cult that creates guilt, not atonement’ (__der erste Fall eines nicht entsühnenden, sondern verschuldenden Kultus__). Since there is no possibility of relieving debt and guilt, the state of unfreedom perpetuates itself: ‘A vast sense of guilt that is unable to find relief seizes on the cult, not to atone for this guilt but to make it universal.’"

- **My Questions/Comments**:
    - ^^Is neoliberalism really responsible for the phenomena of compulsive self-regulation?^^
        - In [Ch. 1: The Crisis of Freedom](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/swine/page/TUE8uJaAL), Byung-Chul Han outlines his belief that the cultural logic of [[neoliberalism]] has rendered its __subjects__ into __projects__, people who are "always refashioning and reinventing" themselves, self-imposing "internal limitations and self-constraints...taking the form of compulsive achievement and optimization." No longer are they impotent subjects, but productive enterprises in and of themselves.
        - Reading this reminded me of Benjamin Franklin's __Thirteen Virtues__. In 1726, at age 20, Franklin [developed a framework of 13 rules to live by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin#Thirteen_Virtues), with the stated aim of using them to cultivate his personal character. Virtues #3-6 are listed as follows:
            - 3. **Order**. __Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.__
            - 4. **Resolution**. __Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.__
            - 5. **Frugality**. __Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.__
            - 6. **Industry**. __Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.__
        - What are the above four virtues if not "internal limitations and self-constraints...taking the form of compulsive achievement and optimization" willingly imposed on one's own self? Byung-Chul Han seems to suggest that self-imposed #productivity regimens are a byproduct of #[[neoliberalism]], but this is evidence to the contrary.
            - To put things in perspective, 1726 was decades before the First Industrial Revolution, which began in 1760. The Second Industrial Revolution, also dubbed the Technological Revolution, is generally dated as occurring between 1870 and 1914. Advances in machinery and factory processes combined with innovations like scientific management (aka Taylorism) led to increased productive capacity and efficiency, in turn leading to a mode of industrialized, standardized mass production called Fordism. In the 1970s, Fordism came to be superseded by post-Fordism—a period marked by, among other things, service industries predominating over manufacturing, the ascendency of information technology, and the globalization of financial markets. Coinciding with this post-Fordism was the neoliberal restructuring of the economy. Neoliberalism came to be the dominant economic order in the 1970s after fractures in the New Deal consensus gave way to a wholesale repudiation of Keynesianism, ushering in a period of capitalism marked by laissez-faire economic policy: privatization, deregulation, and rapid financialization. So, to sum up the above, with his __Thirteen Virtues__, Benjamin Franklin pre-dated by more than three hundred years the "self-productivity" mindset that Byun-Chul Han alleges came to be only under Neoliberalism.
        - Even before Franklin's __Thirteen Virtues__ was the so-called Protestant work ethic, a value system derived from Calvinist doctrine that emphasized the importance of hard work, discipline, and frugality. The phrase was initially coined by Max Weber in his 1905 book __The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism__, in which Weber "asserted that Protestant ethics and values along with the Calvinist doctrine of asceticism and predestination gave birth to capitalism."$$^[1^]$$
        - A charitable interpretation of Byung-Chul Han's claim however is that perhaps neoliberalism, with its deleterious effects on worker autonomy by way of information technology-aided advances in scientific management (see '[bossware](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/inside-invasive-secretive-bossware-tracking-workers)'), has evolved to the point where the role of manager has been imposed onto the worker, leading to a more efficient system of control wherein the worker keeps his or her own self in line. 
            - A re-reading of the following quote from Byung-Chul Han seems to support such an interpretation: "...[The conversion of the 'subject' into the 'project' constitutes] a form of compulsion and constraint – indeed, [a] __more efficient kind of subjectivation and subjugation__. As a project deeming itself free of external and alien limitations, the __I__ is now subjugating itself to internal limitations and self-constraints, which are taking the form of compulsive achievement and optimization."
            - Also, a search for the terms __productivity__, __time management__, __project management__, __attention management__, and __task list__ on the Google Books Ngram Viewer, which mines Google's corpus of 5 million books for any given search term and graphs the number of books in which the word or phrase appears by year, shows that "productivity" as a concept [peaked in usage in 1984 after a steady year-by-year climb](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=productivity&year_start=1900&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cproductivity%3B%2Cc0) and that the other aforementioned terms [only came into parlance in the neoliberal age](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=time+management%2Cproject+management%2Cattention+management%2Ctask+list&year_start=1900&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Ctime%20management%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cproject%20management%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cattention%20management%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctask%20list%3B%2Cc0), skyrocketing in popularity in the mid 90s to early 2000s coinciding with the mainstreaming of the World Wide Web:
                - **productivity**: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fswine%2Fob6DxX1iTS.png?alt=media&token=dfd94fcc-e7b3-4a7d-b77a-9b9b5070f180)
                - **time management, project management, attention management, and task list**: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fswine%2FQDRVUlERBX.png?alt=media&token=606446a1-7fa2-41eb-979f-a8a0d9f6348e)
            - I'm also not even fully sold on the idea that neoliberalism __has__ a cultural logic. People tend to play pretty fast and loose with the word and stretch it way past its literal definition, and Byung-Chul Han writes with broad strokes refusing to hold readers by the hand to spell out his line of exact line of thinking for you. But the guy's obviously very smart and shit so I figure there's something I'm missing. Re-reading what I wrote above a few hours ago, I think I was off the mark with linking neoliberalism to advances in scientific management and using that to explain the imposition of self-managerial behaviors onto workers. In that case, it's probably more accurate to say post-fordism instead of neoliberalism.
            - A better, clearer explanation of the material and structural connections between neoliberalism and the personal productivity/"self-help" phenomenon is that neoliberalism a) gave rise to massive inequality in the absence of an adequate public social safety net, b) made way for the financialization of housing making residents vulnerable to displacement from rising rent c) has allowed both healthcare and education to become privatized industries, enabling price gouging for things that shouldn't be commodified in the first place leading people to rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, d) allowed for too-big-to-fail institutions to escape responsibility for causing the ’08 recession, which led to mass home foreclosures and job loss (fun fact 80% of all new jobs gained since have been gig work!) etc etc. Too many examples of how neoliberal policy immiserates the populace. People live extremely precarious lives, are overworked and underpaid and can only barely afford rent and other basic expenses. Many can’t even do that. ^^Social mobility is practically nonexistent and in the absence of an honest, head-on confrontation of these problems from the political establishment, rugged individualism and pick yourself up from the bootstraps type narratives proliferate (with the help of a conservative think tank / media apparatus), of which the productivity/self-help genre is a close cousin of. Socioeconomic failings are rendered as personal ones. Marie Kondo decluttering, GTD-like task management systems, and new new age fads like "mindfulness" become the means for self-actualization, self-optimization, self-fulfillment in a world that leaves people alienated, atomized, and without a sense of control over the direction of their lives.^^
            - So it's a little misleading to say that neoliberalism __directly__ inculcates in its subjects a desire to self-regulate. It's a lot more downstream than that. Byung-Chul Han has a penchant for this sort of reductionism though. He problematizes the distinction between proletariat and bourgeoise under neoliberalism, for example, arguing that the dynamic of class conflict no longer holds as workers have come to be "auto-exploited" instead of "allo-exploited”: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fswine%2FPaH6MXUBuk.png?alt=media&token=f8a3aa16-88b5-4052-b883-47fcce686967)
